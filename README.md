# Machine_Learning

This repository aims to compare and evaluate machine learning models to predict lung cancer outcomes using TCGA clinical and genomic data. After preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost were implemented. KNN, with its high accuracy and robust performance, was selected as the best model.
